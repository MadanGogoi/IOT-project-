# IOT-project-
It is a IOT project where I am using LM35 and NodeMCU. Its work is to detect any anamoly detection and predict the temperature.

For sending data from LM35 to the server , I am using NodeMCU1.0 which is a wifi module.
I am using Embedded C for LM35 in androidIDE.

#Anamonly_Detection
I am using the Z-score algorithm in php from scratch.

#Prediction the Temperature
I am using the Weighted Moving Algorithm which is also written in PHP  from scratch.
